ASCII ART PROJECT

OVERVIEW

Greetings, computer programmers! Time for you to get a chance to show off your
artistic side.

In this assignment, you are given four shapes to draw programaticaly: a
rectangle, a parallelogram, a right triangle, and your own made up shape. To
complete this assignment, you will need to use your knowledge of primitive
data types, strings, conditionals (if/else statements) and for loops.


REQUIREMENTS

* Your program should be able to draw these shapes with any numerical values given as
input. Do not simply set the values to be, for example, 3 and 4 every time.
* The shapes you draw should not have extra spaces at the end of any line.
* Make sure that your shapes work with 0 and 1 as input.
* Your made up shape take in at least one dimension as input.


GETTING STARTED

The very first thing you should do is copy this folder and change the name of it
to the following:

YourName_GradeNumber_DrawingQuestion

For example, were I a very smart fifth grader I would change the name to this:

Gabe_5_DrawingQuestion

From here, you will write the necessary code to draw each of your shapes. I recommend
doing them in the order that they come in.

To test your program, you can compile the whole project (Ctrl-K) right click on the Drawing class,
and call the function that you would like to test. When you're testing your code, make sure you
start off by using small enough numbers so that you can count the asterisks to see whether you
have the right answer.


ANSWER

If you have the correct solution, your program should something look like this:

Drawing rectangle with width of 3 and height of 4...
* * *
* * *
* * *
* * *

Drawing parallelogram with width of 3 and height of 4...
* * *
  * * *
    * * *
      * * *

Drawing right triangle with height and width of 4...
*
* *
*   *
* * * *

Take note that most of the shapes have two spaces in between them as opposed to one. If you
